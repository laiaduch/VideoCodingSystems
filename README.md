# VideoEncodingSystems
This repository has been created to upload the results of the Audio and Video Systems Coding course. There is a folder for each laboratory.

## Lab 1. JPEG & MPEG
In the Lab 1 folder, you can find the Python script rgb_yuv.py, where all the functions for various tasks are implemented. This script also includes testing of the functions where the user interacts. For tasks involving an image, the same image has been used (which can also be found in this folder).
