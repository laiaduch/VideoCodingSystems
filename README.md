# VideoCodingSystems
This repository has been created to upload the results of the Audio and Video Systems Coding course. There is a folder for each laboratory.

## Lab 1. JPEG & MPEG
In the Lab 1 folder, you can find the Python script rgb_yuv.py, where all the functions for various tasks are implemented. This script also includes testing of the functions where the user interacts. In this folder, you can find the image used for tasks requiring input images. You can also find a file named 'Report Lab 1.pdf' where I explain how the script works and what each task accomplishes.

## Lab 2. Python & Video
The objective of this lab is to create different methods for video processing. In our case, we use the Big Buck Bunny video (which can be found in the Lab 2 folder). In Lab 2, there are two scripts (convert_to_mpeg.py and task5.py). Each of the scripts includes testing for the functions created. We can find the results obtained for the first script on /Lab2/Results, and for the second one on /Lab2/Results/task5.
