## VideoEncodingSystems_Lab1
This repository has been created to upload the results obtained for Lab 1 of the Audio and Video Systems Coding course.

# Task 1
The goal of this task is to create a translator that converts RGB values to YUV values and vice versa. The script, named rgb_yuv.py, is capable of performing these operations. This script includes an interactive section that allows the user to choose which operation they want to perform and which values they want to convert.

# Task 2
In this task we want to create a method in the previous script (rgb_yuv.py) that is able to resize images into lower quality using ffmpeg. The command used to convert the image is the following:

The results obtained can be found in the folder named Task 2, where you can find the original image called eddie.jpg and the output image named eddie_resized.jpg.

# Task 3
For this task, I have created a new script called serpentine.py that includes an implementation of a method that can read the bytes of a JPEG file in a serpentine way. This script also contains a test of the function, which uses the same JPEG image from the previous exercise.

# Task 4
The script called convert_bw.py has an implementation of a method that is capable to convert and compress an image into b/w using ffmpeg.

# Task 5
The script run_length.py, has a method that performs run-length encoding on a series of given bytes. Additionally, this script includes a test of the function using specific bytes to ensure everything is functioning correctly.

# Task 6
For the last task, I have created a script called dct.py, which contains a class capable of converting and decoding an input using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Within this class, there are two methods: one for computing the DCT and another for computing the inverse DCT.
